# Exploring_Data_with_Python
##Introduction

Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. Although the end result of data analysis might be a report or a machine learning model, data scientists begin their work with data, with Python being the most popular programming language data scientists use for working with data.

After decades of open-source development, Python provides extensive functionality with powerful statistical and numerical libraries:

-> NumPy and Pandas simplify analyzing and manipulating data
-> Matplotlib provides attractive data visualizations
-> Scikit-learn offers simple and effective predictive data analysis
-> TensorFlow and PyTorch supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities
