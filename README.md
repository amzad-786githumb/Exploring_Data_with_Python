# Exploring_Data_with_Python
<h2>Introduction</h2>

Unsurprisingly, the role of a data scientist primarily involves exploring and analyzing data. Although the end result of data analysis might be a report or a machine learning model, data scientists begin their work with data, with Python being the most popular programming language data scientists use for working with data.

After decades of open-source development, Python provides extensive functionality with powerful statistical and numerical libraries:

<ol>NumPy and Pandas simplify analyzing and manipulating data</ol>
<ol>Matplotlib provides attractive data visualizations</ol>
<ol>Scikit-learn offers simple and effective predictive data analysis</ol>
<ol>TensorFlow and PyTorch supply machine learning and deep learning capabilities</ol>
